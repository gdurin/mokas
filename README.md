MOKAS: a MOKe Analysis Software
===============================


MOKAS (MOKe Analysis Software) is an open-source project to analyse experimental MOKE data. It is totally written in Python, and it is available on github at github.com/gdurin/mokas. The code makes extensive use of CUDA for parallel computing, highly improving the speed of the calculation. Several output plots are available, to better study the magnetization dynamics in magnetic bubbles and wires at the nanoscale.

The version for magnetic bubbles is running under ipython notebook, see the example. On the other side, the wire version under notebook is still in progress as well the analysis of simulations.

To open the notebooks, download the files into a directory on your computer and from that directory run:

    $ ipython notebook

This will open a new page in your browser with a list of the available notebooks.

The notebooks have been made using Python 3.X, and work well with the Anaconda Distribution
